# Heart-Attack-dataset-Preprocessing
## TSK-000-184: 

Heart attack dataset collected from Kaggle for data analysis.

## The attributes of the dataset include the following:

- age
- gender
- heart rate
- systolic blood pressure
- diastolic blood pressure
- blood sugar
- ck-mb
- troponin 
- negative or positive results 

The medical dataset classifies either the patient is likely to have a heart attack or not. The positive and negative output is displayed by 1 or 0 respectively. The genders, male and female are set to value 1 and 0 respectively in the dataset. If blood glucose levels are above 120 then the values for the attribute are set to 1 otherwise 0.

## Conclusion
There were no duplicates or null values in our data. Also we performed normalization on CK-MB data column using Min-Max scaling to acquire values in a certain range.
